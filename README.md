# ToDoList
ToDoList is a simple web application that allows users to create, track and cross off a list of tasks. The inspiration for this project came after I began reading Jon Duckett's Javascript and JQuery book. I felt that I had a basic understanding of JQuery and wanted to apply my knowledge by creating this small project.

## Technology Used
This project utilizes Vanilla Javascript, JQuery and Bootstrap.
