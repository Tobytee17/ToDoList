# ToDoList
This project is your stock standard Todo-list application. It was created for the purpose of creating a 'first project' using the skills that I learnt throughout my first week of learnin NodeJS. I decided it would be a good idea to repurpose my old Todo-List application, as I feel I have come a long way since originally making it.

# Technology Used
This project utilises:
* HTML/CSS (Bootstrap)
* EJS for templating
* Javascript & JQuery
* NodeJS
* Express
* MongoDB

# Test it for yourself
If you want to test my application for yourself, clone the repository, navigate to the directory and 'npm install' all of the dependancies. You can then run the application and go to '127.0.0.1/3000' to play around with the application. Note: You will need your own .env file to handle the database connection.
